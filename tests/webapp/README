UI/end-user tests based on codeceptjs. Few commands to help develop/debug tests

Run the tests with a chromium window, to see what's going on:
$ npx codeceptjs run --steps

Same but pause when a test fails (super handy to debug):
npx codeceptjs run --steps -p pauseOnFail

Just run a codeceptjs shell to type commands (developing a test)
npx codeceptjs shell
